# DataStructure_Algorithms
Data structures are the fundamental building blocks used to organize and manage data in computer science and programming. They provide a way to store, access, and manipulate data efficiently
Data structures can be classified into two main categories:

*Primitive Data Structures: These are basic data types provided by the programming language, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans. They are usually built into the language and are used to represent simple values.

*Abstract Data Types (ADTs): These are more complex structures that are built using primitive data types and operations. They provide a higher level of abstraction and encapsulation, hiding the implementation details from the user. Examples of abstract data types include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.

**some common data structures:

**Arrays: An ordered collection of elements of the same type, indexed by integers.

**Linked Lists: A collection of nodes where each node contains a data element and a reference to the next node in the sequence.


**Stacks: A Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end, called the top.

**Queues: A First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

**Trees: Hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes connected by edges, with a single root node at the top.

**Graphs: Non-linear data structures consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes.

**Hash Tables: Data structures that store key-value pairs, providing fast insertion, deletion, and lookup operations based on the key.

**an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules used to solve a specific problem or perform a task. Essentially, it's a sequence of well-defined instructions designed to achieve a particular objective. Algorithms are fundamental to computer science and play a crucial role in software development.

**commonly used algorithms :

**Sorting Algorithms:
**Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

**Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

**Quick Sort: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions the list into two sublists around a pivot element and recursively sorts the sublists.

**Searching Algorithms:
**Linear Search: A straightforward search algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list until a match is found or the end of the list is reached.

**Binary Search: An efficient search algorithm for sorted lists that repeatedly divides the search interval in half, eliminating half of the remaining elements each time.

**Graph Algorithms:
**Breadth-First Search (BFS): An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures that explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.


**Depth-First Search (DFS): Another graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

**Dynamic Programming Algorithms:

**Fibonacci Sequence: Although not an algorithm per se, dynamic programming is commonly applied to solve problems like finding Fibonacci numbers or optimizing certain recursive functions.

**Knapsack Problem: A classic optimization problem that seeks to maximize the value of items in a knapsack without exceeding its capacity.

Hashing Algorithms:

**SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm): A family of cryptographic hash functions used to generate unique fixed-size hash values from input data.
